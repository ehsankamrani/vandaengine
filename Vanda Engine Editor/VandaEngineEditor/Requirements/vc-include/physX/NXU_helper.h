 The application needs only implement the callback methods that they are interested in receiving.
 To receive notification events be absolutely certain the application prototypes the method
 in exactly the same way found here.  A small typo may cause the code to instead use the
 default method and application will never be called.

 \note During 'pre-notification' events the application is allowed to modify the descriptor provided.  If the user allocates any memory during any callback then it is responsible for de-allocating that memory.

 \brief The NxuStream serialization library is contained within the namespace 'NXU'

  The NxuStream library handles serialization of all SDK objects.  It is delivered
  as a 'source code' library.  Simply add the source code into the application project and build
  it.  To use the NxuStream library include only a single header file 'NXU_Helper.h'
  and call the discrete methods.

  NxuStream data can be imported as binary, XML, or the COLLADA 1.4.1 physics format.  It can
  be exported in any of these three formats as well.  For example, here is how to load
  a BINARY NxuStream file and save it as a COLLADA file.  An asset, no matter how large or small,
  is referred to as an NXU::NxuPhysicsCollection.


  NXU::NxuPhysicsCollection *c = NXU::loadCollection("test.nxb", NXU::FT_BINARY );

  if ( c ) NXU::saveCollection(c,"test.dae", NXU::FT_COLLADA );

  A 'physics collection' is a set of related scenes, meshes, actors, constraints, cloth, and
  soft bodies, fluids.  If can be everything in an entire game level or something as simple as just
  one 'chair'  Once a physics collection has been instantiated on the SDK it can be released
  without memory leaks or dangling pointers.

	Collections can be loaded and saved from a buffer in memory, which allows the application the
	opportunity to perform its	own file access.

	In addition to being able to serialize the entire contents of the PhysX SDK, or a single scene, an
	application can also serialize individual objects and save them out directly.

  NxuStream allows the application to set an error reporting callback so that warnings and errors that
  might occur during processing can be captured.

  In addition to being notified after an object is created the application can also be 'pre-notified'.
  This allows the application to modify the descriptor or decline to have the object created at all.
  Additionally, each physics object has an optional 'user properties' field which can contain an arbitrary
  string of ASCII data.  This ASCII data might contain early or late binding information used by the game
  engine to associate physics content with other assets in the game.

  A small amount of persistent memory is allocated by the NxuStream library to keep track of name fields,
  user properties, and mesh data that has been instantiated.  When an application exits *or* resets the state
  of the PhysX SDK it should invoke the method NXU::releasePersistentMemory to reset this state.
