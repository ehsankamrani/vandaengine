// This is an alternative to the daeSIDResolver class. It's recommended you use
// this class instead. Typical usage: get the element a sid ref points to. For
// example, if you want to find the element with sid 'sampler' using a
// daeElement pointer named 'effect', that would look like this:
//   daeElement* elt = daeSidRef("sampler", effect).resolve().elt

	// A helper class for returning all the data retrieved when a sid is resolved.

/**
 * The daeSIDResolver class is designed to resolve sid references within a COLLADA document.
 * The rules for sid resolution are set forth by the Addressing Syntax section in Chapter 3 of the
 * COLLADA specification which can be found at https://www.khronos.org/collada .
 * This resolver always attempts to resolve to the daeElement which is referenced. If the element contains 
 * a daeDoubleArray (domFloatArray) value, the resolver will set the pointer to that array. The
 * resolver will also do this if the sid target points to a <source> element which has a <float_array> as
 * a child. If the sid target specifies a value, i.e. blah.X or blah(6), the resolver will attempt to
 * get a pointer to that specific value. The resolver only attempts to resolve to that level for values which
 * are defined in the COMMON profile glossary of the COLLADA specification, or values reference with the (#)
 * syntax. You can check the return value from getState() to see which level of resolution is possible.
