/**
\brief This structure captures results for a single raycast query.

All members of the NxRaycastHit structure are not always available. For example when the ray hits a sphere,
the faceID member is not computed. Also, when raycasting against bounds (AABBs) instead of actual shapes,
some members are not available either. 

Some members like barycentric coordinates are currently only computed for triangle meshes and convexes, but next versions
might provide them in other cases. The client code should check #flags to make sure returned values are
relevant.

When used as hint flags in raycasting queries, those bits control what the user would like to see computed
in the NxRaycastHit structure. For example, you might tell the SDK to compute impact normals using the
NX_RAYCAST_NORMAL hint flag. It's usually faster to let the SDK do it, instead of fetching relevant data
again in the client app. However all users may not need this information. In this case, just omit this flag
and corresponding member of ::NxRaycastHit will not be computed internally - saving processing time. 

Note that NX_RAYCAST_NORMAL computes a smoothed normal, while NX_RAYCAST_FACE_NORMAL only returns the usual
normal of a triangle (i.e. the normalized cross product of two edges).

See #NxScene and #NxShape for raycasting methods.

 <b>Threading:</b> It is not necessary to make this class thread safe as it will only be called in the context of the
 user thread.
